## Notes
- Do not look at the source code, try to think about it on a white board first. You’re doing this for yourself.
- Matching string sequences is one of the most common problems you’ll face as a programmer.
- Condition your brain to think in the world of data structures.
- You can time it to see how fast the computation takes, run benchmarks, much great learning! wow!
- Lots of places where you can encounter pitfalls, if you decide to use C you will learn a great deal about memory management!

    - For each command you have to fork, exec, and then wait for the process to finish.
    - Once there’s a shell that can handle execution of single commands, it can be interesting to implement pipes and file redirection with dup2, or shell metacharacters like $! with the wait() syscall. Around this time it’s also a good chance to learn about zombies and orphans, and how double forking can be used to daemonize a process.
- Pick an RFC like RFC4648 and go down the rabbit hole implementing it.
- Implement a debugging socket proxy.

    - Start by leveraging plenty of existing tools, but over time replacing them with pieces that you’re curious about the details of.
    - Start with something like a few instances of memcache and create a central coordinator that maps keys to servers, then have each instance run its own coordinator that has peer discovery and leader election built in
