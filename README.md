Inspiration for the name comes from eminem's Lose Yourself, just in case you're wondering.

### So what's all this about?
This repo is a todolist/bucketlist/syllabus for computersciency things I wanted to study and dive into for last 3-4 years.
I am a 3rd year computer science student and i am dropping a year(will continue college next year) to GSD.
This repo will be basically the **roadmap** for next few months, It's April 19th 2018. I'll be continuing college January next year
with juniors.

Trying to avoid "Oh i wish I found this earlier problem"

### Why is this so important for me?
I am dumb. I might think i suffer from imposter syndrome because it might make me feel good about myself
sometimes but bottom line is I AM ULTRA DUMBO and I've been dumb ever since.

I can't do simple math calculations properly but somehow i am good at computers and that's the only thing
I am good at, but as I am advancing my studies being dumb will cause problems in future.

So this year, I ma be smart with the dumbest move ever(dropping a year)

I've been programming in various languages, made few webapps for last two years, but I am master of none.
I've contributed to some oss projects but none of the patches
I send are correct in the first(I know it does not have to be like that). Basically I can program but I am a bad programmer
and I want to be a good programmer, a real programmer as people say. OneShot is all about that.

I've always been very much in computer networks and systems admin, though I love hardcore programming.
Then in the last few months I discovered distributed systems and decided this is the direction i want to be going.

The things I want to learn are collected over various sources that I collected over the years.
The syllabus document goes in more depth.

So from OneShot, I expect these few things:

- To be good in maths
- To be good in algo&ds
- To be good in systems programming, OS and C
- To be good in network programming
- To be able to read simple and domain related research papers
- To have some kind of keen interest in P2P networks
- To have a understanding of distributed systems and do some stuff with it
- Build and understand cool stuff like compilers, interpreters etc.
- Write blog
- Most importantly, **to be deciplined and to learn time management.**
