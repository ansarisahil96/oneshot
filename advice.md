## Advices
-  Make sure to do spaced repetition
- I would guess that any company doing distsys work would be impressed by you having a Raft or Paxos implementation on GitHub, enough to get an interview etc.
- It takes discipline and hard work to get multithreaded programming right but there are plenty of silver bullets and snake oil being pushed.
- "If you want someone who is an expert in X and who knows all of the tricks for using X, then you probably should look for someone else. If you want a solid programmer who is going to help you get your code base in order, then I'm your guy."
-  i came to the conclusion that i won't understand something if i don't care
- When learning, more important is practice and making your skill better. Sometimes you can get creative but practice and working on the skill gets more important than being creative here. (my mistake i guess)
- If the list is long, just wrap everything about one item before moving on to the next one. like dont think you'll apply magic to all of them at once. see what fits.
