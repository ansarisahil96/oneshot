### Level 2
- Book
    - [Little book of semaphors:](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qNecKmt28RiBKW7qaB6JGRV_MGiOvrE8) Read this book but "I teach OS, and I still cover semaphores, but I always tell the class that I don't think they are very useful. I spend much more time on condition variables." so, Just know what it has to offer, you might never use it.
